Start reflection for course 2: "More C# Programming and Unity"


Exercise7 Newton and apples!!! ................
void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D col)
{
    Apple apple = col.gameObject.GetComponent<Apple>();
    health += apple.Health;
    print("Current health: " + health);
    Destroy(col.gameObject);

}

// Open the text file using a stream reader. ConfigurationDataFileName 
//	is in StreamingAssetsPath directory
	StreamReader sr = null;
    sr = File.OpenText(Path.Combine(Application.streamingAssetsPath,
        ConfigurationDataFileName));
	string line = sr.ReadLine();
	sr.Close();
		
Be sure to select the Canvas in the HUD game object and change the UI Scale Mode in the
Canvas Scaler component to Scale With Screen Size. Add Text for information purpose.

Events-Menus:
----------------Invoker-Listener-EventManager--------
Invoker -> DestroyButton includes:
	DestroyEvent destroyEvent = new DestroyEvent(); 			-create event object.
	EventManager.AddDestroyEventInvoker(this); 					-add itself as invoker in EventManager (static class)
	public void AddDestroyEventListener(UnityAction listener) : -add listener to event object!
		destroyEvent.AddListener(listener); 
	public void HandleButtonClicked(): 							-throws event! add OnClick to Button in U-manager!
		destroyEvent.Invoke();
		
Listener -> TeddyBear includes:
	EventManager.AddDestroyEventListener(HandleDestroyEvent);	-add handler to EventManager as (UnityAction listener)
	void HandleDestroyEvent():									-makes handler (Destroy TeddyBear)
        Destroy(gameObject);
		
EventManager static has:
	static Invoker (DestroyButton);
	static Listener (TeddyBear);
	
	public static void AddDestroyEventInvoker(DestroyButton invoker): -registration method
		if listener != null:
			invoker.AddDestroyEventListener(listener);				  -invoker add listener
	public static void AddDestroyEventListener(UnityAction listener): -reflection listener
		if (invoker != null):
			invoker.AddDestroyEventListener(listener);				  -invoker add listener
			
----------------Invoker-Listener-EventManager--------	
Randomize enum picking: =========
	using System;
    private PickupEffect GetRandomEnum() {
        Array values = Enum.GetValues(typeof(PickupEffect));
        System.Random random = new System.Random(); // Ambiguous conflict: Set full name.
        PickupEffect randomEffect =
            (PickupEffect)values.GetValue(random.Next(values.Length));
        return randomEffect;
    }
	
	
Better Random Generator: ???!!!
	int newSeed = Guid.NewGuid().GetHashCode();
    Random rnd = new Random(newSeed);
	rnd.Next(0, 2);			

C# Collections and all staff:
	http://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-list	
	
Graphs: 
Search(int start, int finish, Graph<int> graph
LinkedList<GraphNode<int>> searchList	
if (start == finish) -Nothing to search;
if (graph.Find(start) == null || graph.Find(finish) == null) -Nothing to search;
else
	Dictionary<GraphNode<int>, PathNodeInfo<int>> pathNodes <- point to previous node;
	searchList.AddFirst(startNode);
	while (searchList.Count > 0)...
		GraphNode<int> currentNode = searchList.First.Value;
        searchList.RemoveFirst(); ...!!!
		foreach (GraphNode<int> neighbor in currentNode.Neighbors) ...
			if (neighbor.Value == finish) ...
			else if (pathNodes.ContainsKey(neighbor)) do nothing - cyckle!
				// link neighbor to current node in path
                pathNodes.Add(neighbor, new PathNodeInfo<int>(currentNode));
				if (searchType == SearchType.DepthFirst)
                    searchList.AddFirst(neighbor);  <- !!!!!!!!!
				else (BreadthFirst) mey give shorter path!!!
					searchList.AddLast(neighbor);
					
Debug.DrawRay(transform.position, Vector3.down, Color.red); - produce red stick downward. 
		(play, pause ... select the object, with move tool you can see locat. point.

Use BoxColider as trigger (allow move through) if put v in "Is trigger"	!
Use Invoke("FunctionName", o.5f) - invoke function 	FunctionName after 0.5 second.
Destroy(transform.parent.gameObject, 2f); 2f = 2s deley before will be destroyed;

Text animating:
	Window-> Animation -> Animator,
	Window-> Animation -> Animation (F6);
	Samples - speed

To create Singeltone from MyClass : MonoBehaviour class
declare:
	public static MyClass instance;
	
	private void Awake() {
        if(instance == null) {
            instance = this;  // Singleton realization !!!
        }
    }

Assets download:

yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.5f); wait0.5 second ...!
StartCoroutine("SpawnFruit"); - starts function SpawnFruit.
InvokeRepeating("SpawnFruit", 1, 6f); every 6 second N words ... ?
	
Vector3 pos = transform.position;
pos.x =  Mathf.Clamp(pos.x, -maxX, maxX); Clamps left-right position inside min-maxX

3D Runner Game
Animations of 3D assets, connect diff animations

Version Controlling:
Bitbucket - allows private repositories.
GitHub create .gitignore inside if I pick right template, Unity - for-ex.
SourceTree - GUI Mercurial client ...

Input.touchCount - counts how many touches occur on mobile screen.
Input.GetTouch(int index) returns Touch structure with whole information about touches.
Input.GetTouch(0).position - returns a position of first touch.
Input.GetTouch(0).phase: TouchPhase.Began, .Moved, .Ended 
Use Debug.Log("my string") - to console out!

Edit->Project Settings -> Input bring to Axes -> All inputs!!!

How to prepare for an Interview for Game Developer (Unity 3D)
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-prepare-interview-game-developer-unity-3d-vineet-kumar

I often get mails from people asking me "How do i start career in gaming" and many Unity Dev
 ask for "Interview Questions" . In this post i'll be sharing the most basic questions usually
 asked by me and other Interviewers .So what you thing first criteria should be ?  To be a gamer
 at least , i think.  Even if you are not a gamer  , try to play games  and you will see the 
 First thing to remember is that No Interviewer directly jumps to Unity Questions , specially
 when you have an experience of 0-2 years .

First thing the Interviewer is going to ask you is about your Games and he/she will be asking
 you about the things related to your game . So please don’t even try to  mention the game
 that you didn’t develop.
 
 General Questions :
1. Do you play games ? If yes , then name your favorite ones.
2. He/She will ask you something related to your favorite games.
3. How would you design this mechanism in Unity and much more.
4. How many games have you developed so far ?

Technical Questions : 
Basic questions on OOPS concepts .

Unity Questions :
1. Let’s say I gave you a game  which is lagging(poor performance), how will you find the bottleneck ?
2. How to find inactive gameobjects from script ?
3. What is the use of AssetBundle ?
4.What is batching ?
5. Can i change the script execution order ?
6.  What are Coroutines ? Does it run on different Thread ?

This is not it , I will cover question on Vectors , Physics and more advanced Unity questions in next post.
