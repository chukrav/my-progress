conda create --name deep-learning python=3.6 <--- if not created
activate deep-learning
. . . .

h:\Backup\Udacity\UDLearn\deep-learning-v2-pytorch>activate deep-learning --> start command
pronpt becomes:
(deep-learning) h:\Backup\Udacity\UDLearn\deep-learning-v2-pytorch>jupyter notebook

to start notebook existed:
cd deep-learning-v2-pytorch
activate deep-learning
jupyter notebook

loss function (also called the cost): ℓ=1/2𝑛*∑𝑖𝑛(𝑦𝑖−y_hat𝑖)^2
where 𝑛 is the number of training examples, 𝑦𝑖 are the true labels, and y_hat𝑖 are the predicted labels.
