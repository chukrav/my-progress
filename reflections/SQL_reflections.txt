Some of The Most Important SQL Commands

    SELECT - extracts data from a database
    UPDATE - updates data in a database
    DELETE - deletes data from a database
    INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
    CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
    ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
    CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
    ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
    DROP TABLE - deletes a table
    CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
    DROP INDEX - deletes an index
SELECT:
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name; 
SELECT Country FROM Customers; - only Country column ...
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

The following SQL statement lists the number of different (distinct) customer countries:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
Not working in fifox !!!
SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);

I am on: SQL WHERE Clause!
