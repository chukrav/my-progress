SOP PhD ----------------------

Data mining is the technique of examining a large data structure to find patterns, 
trends, hidden insights which would otherwise would not be possible using simpler 
query based techniques.
It uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms to classify, divide, segment the entire data,
pre-process it as necessary and evaluate the possibility of future events.
    Data Mining is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data or KDD

What are the key characteristics?

    Prediction of likely outcomes or events
    Information about actions that can be taken
    Automated discovery of patterns
    Focus on large datasets and databases
	
How is it different from Machine learning?
 Data mining is considerably different from Machine Learning (ML) but they go hand in hand.
 First we should understand that Data mining is different from Data Extraction. Once we 
 have extracted the data via Scraping or any other source, the technique of finding 
 patters is called data mining.
 
Machine Learning is the science of creating algorithms, neural networks and programs 
which learn on their own or are trained initially by known data. Once developed they 
do not need human interference to improve.(???)
Some applications of Machine learning are:
 Web Search, Image recognition, NLP, Spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, 
 credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, computer vision and drug design.
 
Data mining is the very first step in data science.
 To find patters of hidden insights in data, data mining uses anomaly detection, cluster 
 analysis, association rule mining, et all

Some other key differentiators between data mining and ML are as follows:
 Data mining works on unstructured data; ML uses algorithms and neural networks.
 Data mining sources data from a data warehouse whereas ML reads from external machines, 
 could be data sets as well or live user input.
 Data mining has focus on applications and algorithms whereas ML focuses on theoretical 
 part.

=========== Citation ============
Large amount of data is generated each day and we need new techniques of data mining to 
find hidden insights in data!

STRUCTURE:
Part 1: Introduce yourself, your interests and motivations
Part 2: Summarize your undergraduate and previous graduate career
Part 3: Discuss the relevance of your recent and current activities
Part 4: Elaborate on your academic interests

Essential Tips
1. What the admissions committee will read between the lines: self-motivation, competence, 
potential as a graduate student.
2. Emphasize everything from a positive perspective and write in an active, not a passive voice.
3. Demonstrate everything by example; don’t say directly that you’re a persistent person, 
show it.
4. If there is something important that happened to you that affected your grades, such as 
poverty, illness, or excessive work, state it. Write it affirmatively, showing your perseverance 
despite obstacles. You can elaborate more in your personal statement.
5. Make sure everything is linked with continuity and focus.
6. Unless the specific program says otherwise, be concise; an ideal essay should say everything 
it needs to with brevity. Approximately 500 to 1000 well-selected words 
(1-2 single space pages in 12 point font) is better than more words with less clarity and poor organization.
