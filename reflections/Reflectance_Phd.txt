PhD Studentship in Computer Science at The University of Auckland (NZ)
A New Zealand government funding scheme enables the University of Auckland to offer 
PhD study to international students for the same tuition fees as New Zealand PhD students.
 The 2018 PhD tuition fee is NZ$6,969.60 per annum (approximately US$5053.80* per annum).
 If you are a top student, the university offers a range of Doctoral Scholarships to support our PhD 
 candidates throughout the programme, e.g.,

    University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarships
    China Scholarship Council (CSC) scholarships
    Other Doctoral Scholarships
    More Country-specific Scholarships

SOP PhD ----------------------

Data mining is the technique of examining a large data structure to find patterns, 
trends, hidden insights which would otherwise would not be possible using simpler 
query based techniques.
It uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms to classify, divide, segment the entire data,
pre-process it as necessary and evaluate the possibility of future events.
    Data Mining is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data or KDD

What are the key characteristics?

    Prediction of likely outcomes or events
    Information about actions that can be taken
    Automated discovery of patterns
    Focus on large datasets and databases
	
How is it different from Machine learning?
 Data mining is considerably different from Machine Learning (ML) but they go hand in hand.
 First we should understand that Data mining is different from Data Extraction. Once we 
 have extracted the data via Scraping or any other source, the technique of finding 
 patters is called data mining.
 
Machine Learning is the science of creating algorithms, neural networks and programs 
which learn on their own or are trained initially by known data. Once developed they 
do not need human interference to improve.(???)
Some applications of Machine learning are:
 Web Search, Image recognition, NLP, Spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, 
 credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, computer vision and drug design.
 
Data mining is the very first step in data science.
 To find patters of hidden insights in data, data mining uses anomaly detection, cluster 
 analysis, association rule mining, et all

Some other key differentiators between data mining and ML are as follows:
 Data mining works on unstructured data; ML uses algorithms and neural networks.
 Data mining sources data from a data warehouse whereas ML reads from external machines, 
 could be data sets as well or live user input.
 Data mining has focus on applications and algorithms whereas ML focuses on theoretical 
 part.

=========== Citation ============
Large amount of data is generated each day and we need new techniques of data mining to 
find hidden insights in data!

Подрабатывать:
делая tutorials для студентов через универ, за это где-то около 30 долларов в час платят. 
Есть такой сайт studentjobsearch: https://www.sjs.co.nz/ ;
teaching assistant (около 25 баксов в час), на 1-2 год обычно всех берут;
-на тутора надо, с удовольствием возьмут, если хороший английский.
У тьюторов одних асайментов было по 120 штук на проверку к каждому занятию. на каждый ассаймент 20 мин.
