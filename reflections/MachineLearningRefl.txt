Everyone is welcome!
All learners are welcome to take the foundations course, but completion of a beginning level programming 
course is recommended to fully engage in all of the coursework. If you want to brush up on your Python 
skills, we encourage you to review our free Introduction to Python course.
Learn More About Machine Learning

We encourage you to dive deeper in to machine learning with our Intro to Machine Learning and 
Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch courses.
Both courses are FREE and will help you be even better prepared to take the end-of-course assessment.
You may also find our Version Control with Git course helpful. It is also offered for FREE.

Fairlearn --------------------AZURE Udacity-------------
https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn
Fairlearn is a Python package that empowers developers of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to assess 
their system's fairness and mitigate any observed unfairness issues. Fairlearn contains mitigation 
algorithms as well as a Jupyter widget for model assessment. Besides the source code, this repository 
also contains Jupyter notebooks with examples of Fairlearn usage.

Conclusion:

    Machine Learning is already having a significant impact on almost every aspect of our daily lives
    Machine Learning promises to help advance critically important fields like medicine, transportation, 
		space travel, agriculture, cybersecurity, and many more
    The trends in computing power availability, moving closer to silicon, public cloud HW resource 
		concentration will continue to accelerate in the next decade
    Other medium or long-term scientific breakthroughs (think quantum computing) have the potential of 
		creating even larger ML advancements
    Better understanding of current algorithms, inventing new ones, focusing on transparency and 
		explainability will be also major trends
		
Course recap

This course was meant to be an introduction to the fantastic world of Machine Learning. 
Here is a short recap of our journey:
In Lesson 1, you've learned the fundamentals of Machine Learning, made your first contact with data, 
models, and algorithms, and trained your first model in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

In Lesson 2, you performed a few basic data preparation tasks like import, transformation, and feature 
engineering. You've also trained a classifier and a regressor, and learned to apply the "strength in 
numbers" principle using ensembles and automated Machine Learning.

In Lesson 3, you've learned about supervised and unsupervised learning, two of Machine Learning's 
fundamental approaches. You've also trained and evaluated the performance of classifiers, regressors, 
and clustering models.

In Lesson 4, you got your first taste of Deep Learning and dived into some of the most important 
specialized cases like similarity learning, text classification, feature learning, anomaly detection, 
and forecasting.

In Lesson 5, you've learned to manage compute resources, model training and evaluation processed, and 
operational environment. You've also experienced the use of the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python to 
program the Azure Machine Learning managed services.

Finally, in Lesson 6, you've learned the core principles of responsible AI. You've also learned to train 
transparent and explainable models, and raised your awareness on some of the serious challenges of 
modern AI and Machine Learning.
